# Breast_Cancer_Prediction_Analysis
1)Problem statement:-Breast_Cancer_Prediction_Analysis
Breast Cancer is a global health concern (in women)with a significant impact on individuals and healthcare systems.

2) Why This Problem?
Predicting Breast cancer is a critical problem due to its widespread impact on human health.
detection and accurate prediction can lead to improved patient outcomes.
Cancer prediction models have the potential to assist medical professionals in identifying high-risk individuals and
making informed decisions regarding treatment plans.

As you can see the above graph ,Malignant (M):more than 200 Indicates that the breast mass is cancerous (cancerous tumor).
Benign(B): around 350 Indicates that the breast mass is non-cancerous

As you can see the above graph,correlation matrix heatmap to identify relationships between features.

4) Summary of Challenges:
1)Data Imbalance 2)Feature Selection 3)Data Quality 4)Feature Engineering 5)Preprocessing

6) Solutions/Model Apps:
1)Feature Engineering 2)Ensemble Models 3)Interpretability: Used models that allow for interpretability, such as
AdaBoostClassifier,GradientBoostingClassifier,RandomForestClassifier to explain model predictions.
4)Data Cleaning 5)Data Visualization for better understating and insights of data.

                precision    recall   f1-score   support

           B       0.94      1.00      0.97        72
           M       1.00      0.88      0.94        42

My model accuracy is 96 %,for Benign (non cancerous tumor) precision score is 94%,and recall is 100 %  for Malignan (cancerous tumor)Precision score is 100% and recall is 88%.

5)conclusion:
This models success might indicate the potential for using machine learning algorithms to 
assist medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer more accurately and efficiently.
It could be a valuable decision-support tool to improve patient care.
By leveraging machine learning, we can create predictive tools that aid medical professionals in identifying
and treating cancer earlier.
Overall, cancer prediction models have the potential to make a significant positive impact
on patient outcomes and healthcare decision-making.
